<FONT SIZE="4" COLOR = #000000><b>Research Interests</b></FONT><p>

<p>Justin Sirignano is currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with appointments in the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering and the Coordinated Science Lab, where he is a member of the Signals, Inference & Networks (SINE) group.<p>

<p>  Previously, he was a Chapman Fellow at the Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London (2015-2016) and received his PhD from Stanford University (2010-2015). Justin received his BSE from Princeton University (2006-2010). Justin Sirignano's research won the 2014 SIAM Financial Mathematics and Engineering Conference Paper Prize.  <p>

<p> Justin's research lies at the intersection of applied mathematics, machine learning, and high-performance computing. Our research group is currently working on a range of problems in mathematical finance and engineering. <p>

Current research interests include: 
<ul>

<li> Computational methods, machine learning algorithms, and stochastic models in mathematical finance </li>
<li> Asymptotic analysis of deep learning models (e.g., law of large numbers, central limit theorems, and large deviation principles) </li>
<li> Deep learning methods for scientific, engineering, and financial applications </li>

</ul>

<p> There is an opening for a 2-year postdoc position as well as RA positions. Researchers will benefit from broad collaborations with engineers, computer scientists, and applied mathematicians. They will have access to state-of-the-art super-computing and GPU resources. Projects will leverage massive datasets (petabytes) for both financial and engineering applications. <p>
